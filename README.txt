Run the file from a python shell with the python command

Run the file task_3_simulation.py to obtain the data. The syntax is "python task_3_simulation.py n_games n_battle" 
E.g. if you run "python task_3_simulation.py 500 100" you will simulate 500 games, each one with 100 battles

Run the file task_3_plot.py to visualize the data of the corresponding simulation. The syntax is "python task_3_plot.py n_games n_battle" 
E.g. if you run "python task_3_plot.py 500 100" you will visualize the data obtained with "python task_3_simulation.py 500 100"
